  types of datasources
  --------------------

    -> flat-files 

        limitations of flat-files
        ------------------------

        ==> data format is consist
        ==> data manupilation ( create , update , delete) is difficult
        ==> data query on specific conditions
        ==> data redundancy/duplication
        ==> size constraints

    -> relational/structured/SQL data-source(s)   

        i.e we arrange data in the form tables
